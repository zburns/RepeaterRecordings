# RepeaterRecordings

Time is precious....

I wrote this program because I was using RadioReference (now Broadcastify) to upload various repeater feeds, but the problem was I didn't monitor in real-time the radio traffic since I have to work, eat, sleep, etc.

This program would take the raw data and remove the silence from the feed so I could listen to the traffic.  For example, I could listen to 24 hours of a local repeater in about 1 hour due to the lack of traffic - or I could listen to all the Police/Fire dispatches for an entire day in even less time.  So for me it was handy.

I stopped using RadioReference and Brodcastify because I didn't like their policies.  It's like everything else now-a-days.  You end up wasting your time and engergy writing a Yelp review to have it taken down because the restaurant owner didn't like to hear the truth, or upload radio traffic and support Broadcastify's business and deal with people complaining because I wasn't providing a particular feed in Northwest Ohio.

Anyway, if this is of use to you - go forth and use it.
